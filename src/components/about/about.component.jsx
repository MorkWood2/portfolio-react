        <p>
          In software engineering, I see myself as a fullstack web developer
          with a strength in the frontend. In design, my specialties are digital
          media, video, and hand-drawn illustration with an artistâ€™s attention
          to detail and quality. I have a unique ability to rely on my own
          aesthetic sensibilities to elevate lo-fi wireframes into elegant user
          interfaces, leverage product insights to develop features, and rapidly
          learn new technologies along the way.
        </p>
        <p>
          My startup experience has given me a rich, multi-disciplinary array of
          experiences: designing frontend architecture with ReactJS and GraphQL,
          developing API features with TypeScript and TypeORM, supporting data
          requests with SQL and Node scripts, providing tech support for end
          users, conducting user testing and gathering feature requirements, and
          collaborating on cross-functional agile teams. I am emphatic about
          maintaining strong communication and writing good documentation to
          centralize shared knowledge.
        </p>
        <p>
          Highly curious, analytical, and creative, I am driven by the challenge
          to constantly learn new things and execute with equal care to both
          form and function.
