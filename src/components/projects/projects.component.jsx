          <p>
            A public declaration of my two greatest loves in this world. Coding
            and art. Inspired by the vast array of public art in Oakland and in
            the spirit of photojournalism, this project follows my journey to
            document and showcase some of my favorite pieces in the ever
            changing underworld of street art in the San Francisco Bay Area.
            Leveraging Google Maps Api & Javascript, I carefully designed this
            page to reflect the hues and cultures of the neighborhoods around
            me, this project is the embodiment of art and composition.

          <p>
            COVID19 web dashboard built in React that provides real time data,
            fetched from an open-source API. Utilizes chart.js to spread data to
            visualize metrics. This application is an exercise in functionality,
            all wrapped up in a straightforward interface.
