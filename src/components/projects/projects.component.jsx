          <p>
            A public declaration of my two greatest loves in this world. Coding
            and art. Inspired by the vast array of public art in Oakland and in
            the spirit of photojournalism, this project follows my journey to
            document and showcase some of my favorite pieces in the ever
            changing underworld of street art in the San Francisco Bay Area.
            Leveraging Google Maps Api & Javascript, I carefully designed this
            page to reflect the hues and cultures of the neighborhoods around
            me, this project is the embodiment of art and composition.

          <p>
            Olem Inc. is an e-commerce website that sells appeal. Front-end cart
            and inventory components were designed and developed by integrating
            React, Redux, and the Stripe Api. This progressive web application
            is built with performance, and scale in mind. Tested with Jest, with
            Googleâ€™s Firebase as a backend, it is continuously deployed to
            Heroku.

            interface.
